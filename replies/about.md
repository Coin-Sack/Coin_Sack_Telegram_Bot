*About Coin Sack*

Coin Sack was created with the belief that there need to be stronger, more trustworthy, and more worthwhile projects built throughout the deFi space.

We decided to take this into our own hands by launching Coin Sack; a BEP-20 token featuring battle tested tokenomics, an innovative future roadmap, and a trustworthy team that cares for its investors.

- Liquidity locked for life; never worry about a rug pull
- Buyback war chest with token recycling capabilities
- 15% Buy Fees / 20% Sell Fees
    - 8% / 10% contributed to buyback war chest
    - 4% / 5% distributed as refi holder rewards
    - 3% / 5% contributed to project operations
- No fees applied when transfering tokens between wallets
- Project roadmap designed to drive investor ROI
